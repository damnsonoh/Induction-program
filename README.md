The fourth day of college began in an unexpected way. Just before the scheduled lecture in the auditorium, the entire plan changed abruptly. I had arrived in the afternoon, full of anticipation, only to find out that each branch was now being led to its respective classroom.

Later, we regrouped in the auditorium for a talk by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar, who spoke passionately about the benefits of millets as a superfood. She explained their nutritional value, especially their protein content, and gave us interesting insights into their culinary history.
