The fourth day of college began in an unexpected way. Just before the scheduled lecture in the auditorium, the entire plan changed abruptly. I had arrived in the afternoon, full of anticipation, only to find out that each branch was now being led to its respective classroom.

Amidst the sudden shift, we were welcomed by our seniors who were waiting enthusiastically. During the one-hour class session, we introduced ourselves one by one, helping to break the ice and get to know our new friends. Our seniors also gave us an overview of upcoming events and various club activities, setting the tone for our university life.

Later, we regrouped in the auditorium for a talk by Mrs. Shaffy Makkar, who spoke passionately about the benefits of millets as a superfood. She explained their nutritional value, especially their protein content, and gave us interesting insights into their culinary history.

Her engaging and lively presentation made the session both educational and entertaining, encouraging many of us — including myself — to take active interest in healthier food choices.

The day ended with a renewed sense of unity and awareness, especially around healthy living. As a first-year student, every day brings new surprises and learning opportunities, and I’m looking forward to embracing all the experiences that lie ahead.

The first class was conducted by Prof. Jaspreet Singh from the Physics department, who introduced us to the topic of partial differentiation. He explained its practical applications in solving problems and provided a few practice exercises. He also stressed the importance of revisiting Class 11 and 12 Physics concepts to build a solid base for upcoming topics.

Following this, we attended our Mathematics lecture with Prof. Sandeep Kaur Gill. She informed us that the semester would begin with the study of differential equations. The session started with a few questions to gauge our existing knowledge, after which she unexpectedly asked about our Class 12 board exam marks in Mathematics.

# Induction Program – Day 7
# Date – 08 August, 2025

The seventh day of the induction program stood out from the rest, offering a more practical and exploratory experience. We were instructed to report at 10:00 AM, with the venue set as the workshop area. I managed to find my way there with the help of a kind senior I met along the way. At the entrance, a notice board displayed the list of branches along with the number of students assigned to each respective workshop.

Upon entering, I discovered a series of buildings, each dedicated to a specific craft—smithing, welding, carpentry, and more. I was genuinely impressed by the wide range of facilities the college offers and the variety of skills we will have the chance to learn over the next four years. My designated workshop was the machinery section. Inside, I found an array of machines. While I wasn’t entirely surprised—given that my father owns a factory—I had never personally operated such equipment before.

We were asked to take our seats and wait for all students to arrive. The instructor encouraged us to look around and familiarize ourselves with the machines, though we weren’t allowed to use them yet. Later, he showed us a detailed design sheet of a piece of equipment we will be manufacturing in the near future, giving us a glimpse of the hands-on work ahead.

Once the workshop activities concluded, we were advised to explore the campus and locate specific classrooms and facilities. This exercise was intended to ensure that, once regular classes begin, we can navigate the campus with ease and without any inconvenience.
